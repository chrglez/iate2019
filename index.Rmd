## 1. Introduction

.pull-left[
* A urban destination include a bundle of attractions, which can be classified in different categories.

* During the stay, the tourist visits a certain number of attractions (co-occurrence of visits).

* Knowing the structure of co-occurrence of visits is crucial for attraction cooperation, efficient promotion and impact management. 

    * Which are the factors infuencing the co-occurrence of visits?
    * Is there any evolutionary pattern of this co-occurrence of visits?

###  Literature review. Co-occurrence of visits to attractions

* Co-occurrence of visits is related with the theoretical and empirical studies of within-destination tourist movement [Lew & McKercher, ATR, 2006; McKercher & Lau, TG, 2008; Shoval, McKercher, Ng & Birenboim, ATR, 2011]

* Several factors have been determined in tourist movements: distance decay; role of iconic (popular) attractions; rating in travel websites.

* Tourists interests (or perceived image) can determine the type (category) of attractions to visit [Marine-Roig & Clavé, JDMM, 2016]

* Repeated visitors are more selective than first-timers [Caldeira & Kastenholz, JVM, 2018] 

---

###  Literature review. Social Network Analysis (SNA) for attraction networks

* An attraction network is a set of attractions and weighted edges among them (number of tourist who have visited both attractions)

* Most of previous studies analyzing attraction networks uses exploratory metrics of social networks (e.g. node centrality and clustering).

* An statistical inference method is necessary to determine whether some factors (e.g. popularity) significantly influence on the probability of co-occurrence of visits.

* Exponential random graph models (ERGM) have been recently applied in tourism research [Khalilzadeh, ATR, 2018; Williams & Hristov, TM, 2018]

## 2. Hypothesis

.blue[H1.] The probability of co-occurrence of visits decreases with the physical distance between attractions.

.blue[H2.] Iconic attractions in urban destinations have higher probability to be visited than non-iconic attractions, independently of distance. However, iconic attractions are more prone to be jointly visited with non-iconic attractions.

.blue[H3.] High reviewed/rated attractions in urban destinations are more prone to be visited than low reviewed/rated attractions. Moreover, high reviewed/rated attractions are more prone to be jointly visited with other high reviewed/rated attractions.

.blue[H4.] Non-iconic attractions are more prone to be jointly visited with other attractions belonging to the same category.

# 3. Methodology

## Data sample

* We collect reviews about attractions from Madrid in TripAdvisor from November 2013 to November 2018 and we build attractions-attractions network.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(igraph)
library(networkD3)

# create a dataset:
links <- data.frame(
  from=c(1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4)-1,
  to=c(5,7,6,7,8,7,9,8)-1,
  value = rep(1,8)
)

nodes <- data.frame(
  name=c('T1','T2','T3','T4','A1','A2','A3','A4','A5'),
  group=c(rep('Tourist',4),rep('Attraction',5)),
  value = rep(10,9))

YourColors <- 'd3.scaleOrdinal().range([ "#FFA500", "#4169E1",  "#32CD32",
                                         "#FFC0CB", "#8A2BE2", "#FF6347"]);'

# Plot
p <- forceNetwork(Links = links, Nodes = nodes,
                  Source = "from", Target = "to",
            Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
            Group = "group", colourScale = JS(YourColors),
            fontSize = 24, height="300px", width="300px",
            radiusCalculation = JS("Math.sqrt(d.nodesize)+20"),
            legend = TRUE)
```
---

## Data sample

```{r, echo=FALSE}
src <- c("A1", "A4", "A3")
target <- c("A3", "A2", "A5")
networkData <- data.frame(src, target)

# Plot
p <- simpleNetwork(networkData,height="300px", width="300px")
p
```
---

## Data sample

* Reviews were restricted to those reviewers who explicitly indicate an origin different from Madrid.

* We build five networks corresponding to five consecutive years.

---

## EGRM

Given $Y$ a valued random network variable and $y$ a particular realization, the linear ERGM has the form:
$$P_{\theta,h,g}(Y=y)=\frac{h(y)\cdot\mbox{exp}(\theta\cdot g(y))}{K_{h,g}(\theta)}$$

* $\theta$ is a vector of coefficients; $g(\cdot)$ represents a vector of sufficient statistics in the state space of $Y$; $K$ is the normalized constant; $h(\cdot)$ is the reference measure.
* Given a form of $g(y)$, the solution estimates $\theta$ with the maximum likelihood.
* The solution is implemented in the R-package [ergm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ergm/index.html).

# 5. Conclusions

---

## Conclusions

* This study analyzes factors influencing the co-occurrence of visits to attractions in an urban destination 

* The methodology (ERGM) allows estimating the effect of some individual and relational characteristics of the attractions (popularity, rating, category, distance) on the probability of co-occurrence.

* Some results agree with previous findings in tourist movement studies, such as the negative effect of distance and the positive effect of popularity and ratings.

* New findings are obtained:
    * <ru-blockquote>Iconic attractions are more prone to be jointly visited with non-iconic attractions</ru-blockquote>
    * <ru-blockquote>Homophily is observed in attractions with similar popularity, rating and belonging to the same category.</ru-blockquote> 
    
* Homophily in popularity and category has increased over the years.
